## 2024-05-30 - Fix insecure encryption fallback and cleartext traffic
**Vulnerability:** Weak XOR encryption fallback and cleartext HTTP traffic allowed.
**Learning:** The application had an insecure fallback to XOR encryption if AES-GCM failed, and permitted cleartext HTTP traffic which is risky.
**Prevention:** Removed the XOR fallback to ensure failures fail securely and disabled cleartext traffic in AndroidManifest.xml.
